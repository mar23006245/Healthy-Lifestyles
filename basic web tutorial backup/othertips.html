                Starting and sticking to a healthy weight loss plan can sometimes seem impossible.

Often, people simply lack the motivation to get started or lose their motivation to keep going. Luckily, motivation is something you can work to increase.
<br>
Clearly define all the reasons you want to lose weight and write them down. This will help you stay committed and motivated to reach your weight loss goals.

Try to read through them daily and use them as a reminder when tempted to stray from your weight loss plans.

Your reasons could include preventing diabetes, keeping up with grandchildren, looking your best for an event, improving your self-confidence or fitting into a certain pair of jeans.

Many people start losing weight because their doctor suggested it, but research shows that people are more successful if their weight loss motivation comes from within 
<br>
Many diets and diet products claim quick and easy weight loss. However, most practitioners recommend only losing 1–2 pounds (0.5–1 kg) per week (2Trusted Source).

Setting unattainable goals can lead to feelings of frustration and cause you to give up. On the contrary, setting and accomplishing achievable goals leads to feelings of accomplishment.

Also, people who reach their self-determined weight loss goals are more likely to maintain their weight loss long-term (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).

A study using data from several weight loss centers found that women who expected to lose the most weight were the most likely to drop out of the program (5Trusted Source).

The good news is that just a little weight loss of 5–10% of your body weight can have a large impact on your health. If you are 180 pounds (82 kg), that is just 9–18 pounds (4–8 kg). If you are 250 pounds (113 kg), it’s 13–25 pounds (6–11 kg) (6Trusted Source).

In fact, losing 5–10% of your body weight can (7Trusted Source):

Improve blood sugar control
Reduce the risk of heart disease
Lower cholesterol levels
Reduce joint pain
Reduce the risk of certain cancers
