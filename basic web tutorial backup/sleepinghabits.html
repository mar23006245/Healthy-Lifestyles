                Get at least 30 minutes of exposure to daylight.
Why it matters: Natural light influences your body’s circadian rhythm, which directly affects when you feel sleepy. Early exposure to daylight can help align your sleep-wake pattern and make it easier to sleep at night.
What you can do: Step outside early in the morning if you can, whether it is with your morning cup of coffee or as part of your commute. Letting natural light in through the windows can also help. Aim for at least 30 minutes of natural light exposure each day.
<br>
Go to bed and wake up at the same times every day.
Why it matters: A consistent schedule has been linked with improved sleep, and the timing of everyday activities, such as meals, can impact sleep patterns.
What you can do: Set a consistent wake-up time and start your day with the same routine. Have breakfast, lunch, and dinner around the same times every day. End your day with a consistent bedtime routine.

Sleep deprivation activates something in your brain that hightens your appetite and hunger levels. This is called the eCB reward system, which also makes you crave unhealthy food such as junk food. Furthermore, being sleep deprived may lead to bad lifestyle choices which results in weight gain and possibly diabetes.
<br>
Small changes to your nighttime routine can result in a huge health benefit:
<br>
- Establish a realistic bedtime and stick to it every night, even on the weekends.
<br>
- Maintain comfortable temperature settings and low light levels in your bedroom.
<br>
- Consider a “screen ban” on televisions, computers and tablets, cell phones, and other electronic devices in your bedroom.
<br>
- Abstain from caffeine, alcohol, and large meals in the hours leading up to bedtime.
<br>
- Refrain from using tobacco at any time of day or night.
<br>
-  Exercise during the day; this can help you wind down in the evening and prepare for sleep.
